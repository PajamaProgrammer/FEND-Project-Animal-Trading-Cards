			The Narwhal is a type of whale that lives in the icy waters of the Arctic Seas. The narwhal tusk - 
			found on most males and roughly 15% of females - is actually an enlarged tooth. 
			The spiraled tusk juts from the head and can grow as long as 10 feet. It has a tough core and soft outer 
			layer that can bend significantly without cracking.
